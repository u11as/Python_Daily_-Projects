Python Daily Projects practices 

Day_01

A collection of daily Python practice programs created as part of my continuous learning journey.  
This repository focuses on building strong fundamentals in Python through small exercises and mini projects.

---

## About

This repository contains beginner-level Python scripts that cover essential programming concepts such as data types, mathematical operations, type conversion, and basic project development.

The goal of this repository is to practice Python consistently and strengthen problem-solving skills step by step.

# Python Daily Projects Practices - Day_02

A collection of daily Python practice programs focusing on **control flow and conditional logic**.

## About

Day 2 exercises introducing **if/else statements, elif chains, logical operators, nesting, and modulo operations** through practical mini-projects.

## Projects Included

### Conditional Statements
- Basic `if-else` decision making (If-Else.py)
- Multiple `if-elif-else` chains (Multiple-ifs.py)  
- Nested conditionals (Nesting-and-Elif.py)

### Logical Operations & Modulo
- Even/odd number checker using `%` operator (Modulo.py)
- Combined conditions with `and/or` (Logical-oparation.py)

### Mini Projects
- **Rollercoaster Billing System** (Multiple variations):
  - Height/age-based pricing with photo add-on (Multiple-ifs.py, Logical-oparation.py, Nesting-and-Elif.py)
- **Python Pizza Order Calculator**:
  - Size-based pricing + pepperoni/cheese extras (Python-Pizza-Project.py)
- **Treasure Island Adventure Game**:
  - Multi-level story with 3-choice endings (Tressure-Island-Project.py)

## Key Concepts Practiced

**Control Flow**
```python
if condition:
    # code block
elif another_condition:
    # alternative block
else:
    # default block
